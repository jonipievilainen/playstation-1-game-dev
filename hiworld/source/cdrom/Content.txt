The ConstantThought CD Tools Package is a set of tools mainly meant for Playstation development and those still doing psxdev.

Highlights include (among other things):

MakeCTI
Makes a CTI file based on a directory structure you've built locally.  You can then make a CD image based on this by using BUILDCD.

StripISOToo and Revenge of StripISO
Replacements for STRIPISO that work under Windows XP!

ISOTrim
Basically just tries to chop extra data off the end of an image file that has extra data at the end.  Among other things, it can therefore sorta convert a Nero image into a plain 2048 byte-per-sector ISO.

strip2048
Converts 2352 byte per sector CD images (or PSX license files!) to 2048 byte per sector images.

PadFileMaker
Creates files filled with 0 bytes or a repeating user-defined string.  More fun than than usual ways of making them or getting them!
